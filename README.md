In this project, I work with data collected from the donor database of Blood Transfusion Service Center in Hsin-Chu City in Taiwan. 

The center passes its blood transfusion service bus to one university in Hsin-Chu City to gather blood donated about every three months. The dataset, obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, consists of a random sample of 748 donors.

I predict if a blood donor will donate within a given time window.
